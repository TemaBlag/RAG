## Course Overview

The course covers the following key topics:

1. **Introduction to RAG**: Understanding the fundamentals of RAG, its components, and its significance in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  
2. **Query Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing queries and determining the appropriate retrieval strategy.
  
3. **Self-RAG and Adaptive RAG**: Advanced strategies that incorporate self-reflection and adaptive retrieval techniques.

4. **Implementing RAG**: Hands-on implementation of RAG systems using various models and frameworks.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Understanding and applying metrics for evaluating the performance of RAG systems.

## Notebooks

Each notebook contains detailed comments explaining the code and concepts, as well as modifications made to adapt the code for use with Hugging Face API keys instead of OpenAI API keys.

## Course Overview

### RAG from Scratch
The course covers key topics, including:

1. **Introduction to RAG**: Fundamentals, components, and significance in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2. **Query Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing queries and determining appropriate retrieval strategies.
3. **Self-RAG and Adaptive RAG**: Advanced strategies incorporating self-reflection and adaptive retrieval techniques.
4. **Implementing RAG**: Hands-on implementation of RAG systems using various models and frameworks.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Understanding and applying metrics for evaluating RAG system performance.

### 5 Levels Of Text Splitting
This tutorial explores five levels of text splitting, an effective strategy for enhancing language model performance, particularly for long inputs:

1. **Character Splitting**: Basic static character chunks.
2. **Recursive Character Text Splitting**: Chunking using separators recursively.
3. **Document Specific Splitting**: Tailored methods for different document types (PDF, Python, Markdown).
4. **Semantic Splitting**: Chunking based on embedding walks.
5. **Agentic Splitting**: An experimental agent-like chunking method.

*Bonus Level:* **Alternative Representation Chunking + Indexing**: Derivative representations for improved retrieval.

## Notebooks

Each notebook contains detailed comments explaining the code and concepts, including modifications to adapt the code for use with Hugging Face API keys instead of OpenAI API keys.
