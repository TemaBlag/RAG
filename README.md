# RAG from Scratch

This repository contains notebooks and code examples related to the course ["RAG from Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVcwVQRHIc8&t=3s) offered by [Langsmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith). The course provides a comprehensive introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), covering essential concepts, strategies, and implementations.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following key topics:

1. **Introduction to RAG**: Understanding the fundamentals of RAG, its components, and its significance in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  
2. **Query Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing queries and determining the appropriate retrieval strategy.
  
3. **Self-RAG and Adaptive RAG**: Advanced strategies that incorporate self-reflection and adaptive retrieval techniques.

4. **Implementing RAG**: Hands-on implementation of RAG systems using various models and frameworks.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Understanding and applying metrics for evaluating the performance of RAG systems.

## Notebooks

Each notebook contains detailed comments explaining the code and concepts, as well as modifications made to adapt the code for use with Hugging Face API keys instead of OpenAI API keys.
